        <h3 style="font-family:'Tahoma'">Hi there!</h3>
        <p style="font-family:'Tahoma'">My name is Rohan Suresh. I love taekwondo, woodworking, and guitar. I have a variety of tools, and have made many different boxes, knives, and more. I am also a second degree black belt in taekwondo, and I am a part time instructor at my taekwondo dojang. I love being able to teach children and assist their journey as they progress through the ranks. I am also very passionate about engineering. I love physics, math, and real applications of mathematical concepts in flight. Aerospace engineering is a passion of mine, and I hope to be able to further my engineering education.  </p>
